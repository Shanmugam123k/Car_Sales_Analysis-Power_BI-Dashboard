# Car_Sales_Analysis-Power_BI-Dashboard
The goal of this project is to help stakeholders understand how different car companies and dealer regions contribute to overall revenue, and how customer preferences such as color and transmission impact sales volume.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains car sales records with customer and dealership information.
​
Key columns include:

Company, Model, Body_Style
Dealer_Name, Dealer_Region
Price, Annual_Income
Color, Transmission (Auto/Manual)
Date and other supporting fields for time-based analysis

Dashboard Features
The main dashboard page (shown in the screenshot) includes:
​​
KPI cards showing total Sum of Price and total Sum of Annual Income.

Bar chart: Sum of Price by Company to highlight top revenue-generating brands.

Bar chart: Count of Dealer_Region by Company to show how widely each company is distributed across regions.

Pie chart: Count of Company by Dealer_Region to compare market presence across regions.

Clustered column chart: Count of Company by Color, Dealer_Region, and Transmission to understand color and transmission preferences across regions.

Key Insights
From the current data and visuals:​​
A few companies contribute the highest share of total sales revenue, while several others have smaller but consistent contributions.

Dealer regions are relatively balanced in terms of company counts, with some regions slightly ahead in market presence.

Automatic transmission cars dominate in most regions, and certain colors (such as black and white) appear more frequently than others.
